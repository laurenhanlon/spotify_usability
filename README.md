## Spotify UX Testing
#### Author: Lauren Hanlon

### Introduction

I wholeheartedly believe Spotify is the most incredible application in my lifetime. To look at my stats personally, I estimate that I stream music from Spotify approximately 10 hours of the day: ~1 while at home in the morning, ~1 driving throughout the day and ~8 studying (yes, I study at least 8 hours a day...), which if you average that out across a week, accounting for a little less streaming on the weekends because I like to have fun _sometimes_, I stream around 50 hours a week (someone at Spotify want to confirm this?), which averages to 2600 hours in a year, and 108 straight days of listening to music.

To devaite a bit, I took a User Experience course my sophomore year, where I fell in love with UX research - interacting with users and designers seemed to be a great blend of my social outgoing personality and love of beautiful applications. However, I left my dreams of becoming a UX guru behind in favor of pursuing another passion of mine - mathematics and data science. I love the idea of finding hidden nuggets of insights within terabytes of data and surprising everyone. Lately I've come to the realization that I don't need to separate church and state (i.e. UX and data) and that the connecting thread between these two is simple: _understanding how humans behave_. The only difference is UX is more _qualitative_ while data analytics/science is _quantitative_.

This project serves to blend these two passions of mine - UX research and data analytics/science.

Going back to my love of Spotify, I chose Spotify for this project because while I love Spotify and all it's features, I definitely have some hypotheses about where it's design can improve, and I believe data can help prove that. I also believe that data can be used in the design process as a continuous measure of a design's success, and can help us predict future trends and behaviors that might influence design decisions at an earlier stage.

Hope you enjoy this project, and remember it's a work in progress! In th meantime, here's my current [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1211691460/playlist/6KkmPAIbW7oaR40lCbt8GM)
