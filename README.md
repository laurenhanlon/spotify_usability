## Spotify UX Testing
#### Author: Lauren Hanlon

### Introduction

I wholeheartedly believe Spotify is the most incredible application in my lifetime. To look at my stats personally, I estimate that I stream music from Spotify approximately 10 hours of the day: ~1 while at home in the morning, ~1 driving throughout the day and ~8 studying (yes, I study at least 8 hours a day...), which if you average that out across a week, accounting for a little less streaming on the weekends because I like to have fun _sometimes_, I stream around 50 hours a week (someone at Spotify want to confirm this?), which averages to 2600 hours in a year, and 108 straight days of listening to music.

To devaite a bit, I took a User Experience course my sophomore year, where I fell in love with UX research - interacting with users and designers seemed to be a great blend of my social outgoing personality and love of beautiful applications. However, I left my dreams of becoming a UX guru behind in favor of pursuing another passion of mine - mathematics and data science. I love the idea of finding hidden nuggets of insights within terabytes of data and surprising everyone. Lately I've come to the realization that I don't need to separate church and state (i.e. UX and data) and that the connecting thread between these two is simple: _understanding how humans behave_. The only difference is UX is more _qualitative_ while data analytics/science is _quantitative_.

This project serves to blend these two passions of mine - UX research and data analytics/science.

Going back to my love of Spotify, I chose Spotify for this project because while I love Spotify and all it's features, I definitely have some hypotheses about where it's design can improve, and I believe data can help prove that. I also believe that data can be used in the design process as a continuous measure of a design's success, and can help us predict future trends and behaviors that might influence design decisions at an earlier stage.

Hope you enjoy this project, and remember it's a work in progress! In the meantime, here's my current [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1211691460/playlist/6KkmPAIbW7oaR40lCbt8GM)

### Qualitative UX Testing

The first leg of this project involves some qualitative UX testing. I wanted to look at three different personas and how they interacted with Spotify and some of it's core features to assess where the strengths of Spotify lie, and where there is room for the development of a hypothesis to test with data later on.

I chose three of my friends for my usability test - one experienced, premium Spotify user, one with minimal engagement with Spotify (she is not premium), and one with zero experience using Spotify. I asked them to complete a few basic tasks, and recorded their thoughts and user paths to complete the tasks.

My methodology, tests and findings are in the `report` folder. The output is `usability_report.pdf`.
